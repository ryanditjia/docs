## Scaffold a demo game project (web)

[Install World CLI](https://world.dev/quickstart) if you haven't already. Once you have it installed,
you can scaffold your first demo game by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
world create demo-game # TODO
```

## Start World Engine in development mode

```bash
world cardinal dev # TODO
```

## Start demo game client in development mode

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to run the example demo game for web.

```bash
cd demo-game-client # TODO
```

Then, install dependencies using your preferred package manager.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install
```

```bash yarn
yarn install
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install
```

```bash bun
bun install
```

</CodeGroup>

Once installation is successful, run the demo game client.

```bash
npm run dev

# Then visit http://localhost:5555
```
